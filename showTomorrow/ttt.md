Ideas to minimizing the size of multi-commodity-problem for minimizing the average link utilization

1. Cutoff traffic under certain amount of demand -> 99% of the demand comes from 1% of the traffic values
2. Only add the reachable edges to the model -> check what edges are reachable from the source with a max-depth



noter:
    99% of the total traffic is made up by 8887 traffic values (Show traffic_percentages file)
    8887 out of 58031 traffic values which is 15.3% of the total traffic values
    58031 * 5150 = 298,383,150 traffic values 
    8887 * 5150 = 45,754,350 traffic values
